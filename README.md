The point of this build is to gain insight on authentication flows for API usage.  What I have right meow is a front end (src) and a backend (server.js).  I believe I can use passport-spotify to replace my bacnend portion completely but I am not sure.  I do some investigation but this is what I have so far.

## Instructions to run
1. Clone the repo
2. run `npm install`
3. run `node server.js`
4. go to `localhost:8888/login` in your browser
